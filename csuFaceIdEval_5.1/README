csuFaceIdEval README
--------------------

For detailed information on the algorithms please consult the
"CSU Face Identification Evaluation System User's Guide:
Verion 5.0"

Compiling the system
--------------------

Once the distribution is unpacked, change into the distribution
directory and type "make"

    > cd csuFaceIdEval.*
    > make

A scripts allow you to test the system by running
the normalization code and all the experiments (PCA, LDA, Bayesian 
and EBGM) sequentially:

    runAllTests_scraps.sh
  
This script can be executed from the "csuFaceIdEval.*"
directory with a command in the form:

    > scripts/runAllTests_scraps.sh

After installing and compiling the system, "runAllTests_scraps.sh" should be
run to make sure the system is operating correctly.

Using the provided scripts
==============================

The provided scripts come in two different versions. The "feret"
versions execute tests on a standard FERET image set (not provided)
while the "scraps" versions execute tests on the much smaller 
"csuScrapShots" image set which is provided with this distribution
for testing purposes.

The PGM files for the "csuScrapShots" image set are provided under
"data/csuScrapShots/source/pgm". Those for the FERET image set are
not provided. For the "feret" scripts to work, it is assumed that
the PGM files for the standard FERET sets are copied into the
"data/FERET/source/pgm" directory.

The paths should look like this:
data/FERET/source/pgm/00001fa010_930831.pgm
data/FERET/source/pgm/00001fb010_930831.pgm
data/FERET/source/pgm/00002fa001d_931230.pgm
data/FERET/source/pgm/00002fa010_930831.pgm

As of version 5.1 there is a script that will automatically copy the
data off of the FERET Color DVD Disk 2.  Run this script like:

    > scripts/Process_FERET_DVD.sh /Volumes/CDROM

where /Volumes/CDROM is the top level directory of disk 2.


---------------------
NORMALIZATION SCRIPTS
---------------------

The following two scripts execute the process to convert
the source PGM files into the normalized images that
are needed to perform the experiments:

   scripts/runPreprocessing_scraps.sh
   scripts/runPreprocessing_feret.sh
  
These scripts only need to be executed once. Normalized
images will be stored in "data/FERET/normSep2002*" directories
and "data/csuScrapShots/normSep2002*" directories.

------------------
EXPERIMENT SCRIPTS
------------------

The following scripts run the individual expriments:

   scripts/runBayesian_scraps.sh
   scripts/runBayesian_feret.sh

   scripts/runLDA_scraps.sh
   scripts/runLDA_feret.sh
  
   scripts/runPCA_scraps.sh
   scripts/runPCA_feret.sh

Running these experiments will generate distance information in the
"distances" directory.

-----------------------------------
SCRIPTS FOR GENERATING A RANK CURVE
-----------------------------------

The following script generates recognition rank curves for 4 probe sets
(fafb, fafc, dup1 and dup2) used in the FERET experiment :

   scripts/makeRankCurves_feret.sh

These rank curves are saved as text files in the "results" directory.

-----------------------
UPDATES FOR VERSION 5.1
-----------------------
Fixed an error in the Bayesian computation.
Rescaled EBGM Gabor mask values to be consistent with the USC/Bochum version.
Fixed a convergence condition in the EBGM DEPrediveIter method.
Added scripts to support the new FERET Color DVDs.
Fixed other various bugs.
